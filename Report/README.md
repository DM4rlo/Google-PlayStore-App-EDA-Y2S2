# Google PlayStore App Exploratory Data Analysis
The repository's file structure is organized into three main folders:
1. Code for Analysis: This folder contains all the R code that was written to perform the exploratory data analysis. It includes scripts, notebooks, or R Markdown files that were used to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset. This folder also houses the cleaned dataset that was used in the analysis, ensuring reproducibility and transparency in the research process.

2. Individual Plots: This folder stores all the plots that were generated during the exploratory data analysis. The plots are saved in PDF format to preserve their quality and allow for easy viewing and sharing. This folder serves as a visual archive of the data visualizations created during the analysis, providing insights into the findings and results of the research.

3. Report: This folder contains the fully documented report of the data analysis in PDF format. The report includes detailed explanations of the research methodology, data analysis techniques, and key findings. Additionally, this folder includes the Sweave code used to create the report, which integrates R code and LaTeX to generate a dynamic and reproducible report. The dataset used by the Sweave code is also included in this folder, ensuring that the report can be regenerated with the latest data.

The organized file structure of the repository allows for easy navigation and access to the different components of the project, making it convenient for others to review, replicate, and build upon the research.
